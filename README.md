# Another Book Club

So called that because when I said I was thinking of doing a book club for my personal project an instructor sighed and said "Another book club." So this project was truly an uncreative endeavor, going down the path that so many had gone before. 

But the learning experience was huge. This was the first project I utilized Firebase in, with a persistent database all managed by Google, it made my life really easy once I figured out how to do what I needed to with it. I also learned how to utilize the Redux store in creative ways that made up for some other shortcomings in my firebase knowledge. And the number one thing I will take away from this project is never, ever invite my parents into town for a week right as the project starts. This project would be much cleaner with that extra week to just code.

The entire stack of this project is React, Redux, Router and Firebase.
